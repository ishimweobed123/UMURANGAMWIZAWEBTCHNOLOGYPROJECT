        <h1>the War of Liberation</h1>
        <h2>The following were the major steps of the Liberation War: On October 1st, 1990, the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) and its armed wing (RPA) declared the war of liberation which lasted almost four years. The first attack was in Umutara, but was not successful because of the death of Major General Fred Gisa Rwigema. The RPA was pushed from Umutara after which they changed tactics by launching a guerrilla warfare in the northern region. </h2>
        <p>On January 23rd, 1991, they captured Ruhengeri town and liberated the political prisoners who had been jailed in Ruhengeri prison. Among them, there were Theoneste Lizinde, Biseruka and Brother Jean Damascène Ndayambaje.</p>
        <p>On March 29th, 1991, the first negotiations between the RPF and the government of Rwanda started at N’sélé in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Other meetings, had been held in Arusha G’badolité, and Mwanza. Regarding the internal political evolution, a coalition was formed on March 14th, 1992 by the main opposition political parties. It was called Forces Démocratiques pour le Changement (Democratic Forces for Change). Its aim was to negotiate peace with RPF. </p>
        <p>On July 12th, 1992, a ceasefire was negotiated and signed in the Arusha Peace Agreement between the RPF and the Habyarimana Government. An Organisation of African Unity force known as ‘Groupe d’Observateurs Militaires Neutres’ (GOMN) was to observe the ceasefire. </p>
        <p>On November 15th, 1992, Habyarimana declared the negotiations between the government and RPF null and void. According to him the ceasefire was a mere piece of paper–rubbish–and thanked the Interahamwe killer militia of his MRND Party for the massacres they had committed, especially in the northern part of the country. This growing insecurity was one of the ways used by the Habyarimana regime to block the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement. </p>
        <p>On February 8th, 1993, in response to those massacres, the RPF launched an offensive that resulted in the capture of a large part of the country, especially in the northern region. The RPF were approaching the gates of Kigali. But due to international pressure to resume negotiations, the RPF returned to its former positions around Kinihira. On the side of government, troops had to remain in the new positions. The area between the two armies was declared a demilitarised zone.</p>
        <p>On August 4th,1993, the Arusha Agreement was signed. It was a political compromise for power sharing between the Government and the RPF, but the Broad-based Transitional Government’ failed to take off because Habyarimana refused to swear in the new government and Parliament of which RPF was to be part.</p>
        <p>In December 1993, a United Nations Intervention Force arrived. It was a United Nations Peacekeeping Force known as United Nations Mission for Rwanda (Unamir). Its mission was to supervise the implementation of the Arusha agreement of August 4th, 1993.</p>
        <p>On December 28th, 1993, 600 soldiers of the Third battalion of the RPF arrived at the Conseil National de Développement (CND) to ensure the security of the RPF future ministers and Members of parliament in the new broad-based transition Government</p>
        <p>On January 5th, 1994, President Habyarimana was sworn in as President in accordance with the Arusha Agreement but blocked the swearing in of other members of the Broad-based Transition Government</p>
        <p>From April 7th 1994, the country was ignited in several weeks of intense and systematic genocidal massacres, in which over one million Tutsi perished. It was the Rwanda Patriotic Front which stopped genocide. </p>
        <p>On July 19th, 1994 the Government of National Unity was formed.</p><br>

        <h1>The effects of the Liberation War</h1>
        <h2>The Liberation War was launched on the 1st October 1990 by RPFInkotanyi and its armed wing, the Rwandese Patriotic Army (RPA) and ended on July 4th, 1994 with the fall of Kigali and Butare. It had the following effects:</h2>
        <p>Death of Major General Fred Rwigyema The first effect was the death of Major General Fred Gisa Rwigema the chairman of RPF and the supreme commander of RPA. This death was a great loss for RPF. Death of other Rwandans Many soldiers were killed on both sides and others were wounded. There was also the massacre of “Abagogwe “people from 1991 to 1993 by Habyarimana regime in retaliation for RPA attack. Similar killings were carried out in Kibirira, Bugesera, Kibuye, Murambi and in Umutara</p>
        <p>Displacement, loss of property and phycological effects There was displacement of people from their properties, trauma, and destruction of properties.  Reaction of Rwandans For those in exile, they felt time had come to return home and massively joined the RPF and the struggle as the war progressed. Mobilization to support the war effort was deepened in the region, and recruitment into the RPF was intensified. A lot of money, medicine, food, and clothes were mobilized in support of the war. Inside Rwanda, there were mixed reactions. Some people, mainly sympathizers of the RPF who had been treated as second class citizens, felt time had come for their rescue and joined the struggle from neighboring countries while others were worried about the reaction of the Habyarimana regime.</p> 
        <p>Call by the Government of Rwanda for support The government of Rwanda was supported by its allies. Habyarimana argued that he had been invaded by neighboring Anglophone Uganda and mobilized his closest allies to assist him militarily and diplomatically. Consequently, France, Belgium and the then Zaire (now DRC) under Mobutu Sese Seko sent troops. </p> 
        <p>Increasing of pressure for democratization While the Habyarimana regime was facing the armed struggle with RPF-Inkotanyi on the local fronts, on the international level, Habyarimana was facing pressure to democratise Rwanda (La Baule summit). </p> 
        <h3>The regime also faced internal opposition. In June 1991, Habyarimana was forced to accept the multiparty system by signing a new constitution. Chronology of Rwanda’s democratisation process </h3>
        <h4> In June 1990, at the La Baule Summit in France President François Mitterrand announced that French aid would depend on democratisation. </h4> 
        <h4>On July 5th, 1990, at the MRND congress, President Habyarimana declared that the country was adopting the multiparty system. </h4>
        <h4>On September 1st, 1990, there was a declaration by thirty three intellectuals claiming the establishment of multipartism in Rwanda.</h4>
        <h4>On September 21st, 1990, President Habyarimana established a commission with the task of studying how multipartism could be established in Rwanda. This commission ended its work and submitted its report in January 1991. Meanwhile, on November 11th, 1990, President Habyarimana allowed multipartism and declared the amendment of the Rwandan constitution. In June 1991, the new constitution was approved by the Conseil National de Développement (CND). The new constitution banned political parties based on ethnicity or regional affiliation, the position of prime ministership, and limited the executive, judicial and legislative branches of government. e) Beginning July 1991, new political parties were legally registered. These included Parti Socialiste Démocratique (PSD), Parti Libéral (PL), Mouvement Démocratique Républicain (MDR), Parti Socialiste Rwandais (PSR), Union Démocratique du Peuple Rwandais (UDPR), Parti Ecologiste (PECO), and Parti pour la Démocratie Islamique (PDI). ࿤ The signing of Arusha Peace Agreement The Liberation War led to the signing of Arusha Peace Agreement on August 4th, 1993 whose purpose was to obtain a lasting peace. Both parties, the RPF-Inkotanyi and the Rwanda Government agreed to share power. </h4>
        <h5>However, the Hutu extremists, who felt left out of the process and threatened by the results, were not satisfied and started to organise a genocide against the Tutsi and killing of moderate Hutu. </h5>
        <p> Decline of the economy Because of the war and the pressure on the Habyarimana regime, Rwanda’s economy collapsed. Coffee, which was the main source of foreign currency, was not produced. Thus, the country witnessed a hard economic situation. Besides, foreign aid stopped and the Rwandan franc lost its value. The main sectors of the economicy collapsed. People became poor and discontented. Because of the war, the Northern corridor was closed and this led to the stoppage of commercial exchange with Uganda. Moreover, the war increased the military expenditure of the government and this made the country more and more impoverished. </p> 
        <p>Displacement of many people More than one million Rwandans were displaced inside the country. These were in great need of shelter, food and other basic needs. Among the positive effects of the Liberation War, the following deserve to be mentioned: </p> 
        <p> There is promotion of National unity. <h5>Thanks to the Liberation War, many achievements were made in the national unity, justice, peace and security, and ending of segregation.Corruption, favouritism, embezzlement are being fought. </h5></p>
        <p>All reasons for fleeing the country were eliminated and the refugees are encouraged to return home. </p>
        <p>The war helped to establish a true democracy. The people of Rwanda have the right to choose their leaders at all levels. </p>
        <p>The war contributed to the improvement of the image of the country. Rwandans are well-known all over the world as a good example of reconciliation, people living together on the same land, victims and criminals, after the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. </p>
        <p>The country promoted international relations based on mutual respect, cooperation and mutual economic exchange. This helped the country to reduce economic and political dependence on foreign countries.</p>

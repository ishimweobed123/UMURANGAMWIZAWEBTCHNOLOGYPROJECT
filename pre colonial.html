        <h1>PRE COLONISATION IN RWANDA</h1><br>
        <h2>HOW RWANDAN 'S LIFE WAS BEFORE COLONISATION</h2>
        <P>HERE WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING SECTORS</P>
        <ol>
            <li>marriage</li><br/>
            <li>family</li><br/>
            <li>education</li><br/>

        </ol>
        <h2>Social organisation of the Rwandan traditional society Family</h2>
        <p>A family was the basic unit of society characterised by sharing, giving and receiving. A man (husband) of the first family was the head of the extended family. </p>
        <h2>Marriage</h2>
        <p>Whenever a boy or a girl reached 18 years of age, arrangements for marriage would be done. Marriage was an alliance between two families. There were many steps towards marriage. It was a traditional ceremony led by elders with a lot of care. The couple would live in separate houses and form their own unit.</p>
        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Rwandans fed on agricultural and animal products. They cultivated crops such as cowpeas, broom-corn (sorghum), beans, sweet potatoes, purple yams and calabashes. They also reared cattle for milk and meat.</p>
        <h2>Traditional drinks</h2>
        <p>Rwandans respected their traditional drink so much. They brew and drank urwagwa and amarwa, banana and sorghum beer respectively. They also drank milk and porridge, especially women and sick people</p>
        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        <p>Rwandans had their traditional clothes made from plant products and animal skins. Plant product clothes included bark clothes from fig tree and banana stem barks. They were joined together to make a garment. Clothes of skin included uruyonga for boys over ten years, ishabure indengera for girls and ikanda for women. Men put on calf hides while leopard skins were for kings and chiefs.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Rwandans had informal education which was general and Intore education. Education went with sex and age brackets. Young girls were taught by their mothers and paternal aunts. Boys were taught by their fathers on hunting and agriculture.

            Young boys from rich families went to the kingâ€™s palace to train. They were trained on warrior drills and were commonly known as Intore. </p>
            <h2>Solidarity</h2>
            <p>Rwandans stood for better relations with neighbours and relatives. They made visits, contributed to each other, made marriage alliances and exchanged cows. Solidarity among Rwandans was achieved through gutabarana (physical mutual help), kwishimana (physical moral presence during times of happiness) and gufashanya (helping one another in some activities requiring community intervention on voluntary basis). To strengthen social relations further, blood pacts ritual (kunywana) was also emphasised in traditional Rwanda</p>
            <h2>Cultural organisation</h2>
            <p>Oral literature: Rwandans practised oral literature. Their oral literature included folk tales (imigani), proverbs, riddles and poems. The poems were of many categories. These included pastoral poems, dynastic poems, warrior or epic poems and esoteric code. Other forms of literature were life histories, plays and historical recitations. It was passed down to future generations by word of mouth, typically through memorisation and recitation. It was considered as a verbal form of art. </p>
            <h2>Traditional religion</h2>
            <p>This was one of the most unifying factors that brought Rwandans together. They believed in God (Imana) for everything they were doing. This was seen in giving God (Imana) different names such as Rugira, Ruhanga and Iyakare. Other names given were Iyambere and Rugaba. Different people were given different names to show the supremacy of Imana (God). For example they were given names such as Niyibizi, Niyigena and Nibishaka.

            </p>
           <h3>Rwandans believed and remained in touch with Ryangombe who was regarded as the king of spirits and Abazimu through: </h3>
           <p>Guterekera: Appeasing the living dead by giving sacrifices of beer, food and milk. </p> 
           <p>Kuragura: This was a spiritual divination to consult the gods and keep in touch.</p>
           <p>Kubandwa: This was a special ceremony to worship Ryangombe by imandwa or those who have been initiated to the cult of Ryangombe. The chief imandwa was called Ryangombe. 

            There was also Nyabingi cult in the north eastern part of the kingdom.</p>
            <h1> Rites related to daily life</h1>
            <h2> Rwandan society had various rites such child naming, sexual initiation, death ceremony and taboos.</h2>
            <h3>Child naming</h3>
            <p>This ceremony was done on the evening of the eighth day after a new baby was born. It began with bringing the baby out to the public for the first time. This was called gusohora umwana. All village children from three to ten years would come and cultivate a piece of land using sticks that were shaped in the form of a hoe. Thereafter, a male adult would stop them, and throw water at them. The kids would then run home to be given food in front of adults. The kids would be requested to put forward names, and the father would give the name he had selected. </p>
            <h3>Sexual initiation for girls, Gukuna</h3>
            <p> Young girls were secretly advised and trained to do what was called gukuna. This was a practice of elongating the labia minora. This was done to increase sexual pleasure for both males and females. This was commonly done at puberty stage with some plant extract.  </p>
            <h3>Death ceremony</h3>
            <p> Whenever a person died, family members would take part in certain rituals for send off. There was always a period of mourning (kwirabura) announced by head of the family. During that period, sexual relations and working in fields were forbidden. At the end of it, they performed kwera ceremony, to mark the end of mourning.</p>
            <h3>Taboos and forbidden things</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Children were forbidden to sit on their fathers stool. </li>
                <li>Whistling at night was prohibited. </li>
                <li>  Sitting on a mortar was forbidden. </li>
                <li>One could not marry from his or her own clan. </li>
                <li>A wife was not supposed to mention the name of her father in law. </li>
                <li> Premarital pregnancy was prohibited. </li>
                <li>Girls were forbidden to climb trees.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Political and military organisation</h3>
            <p>The Kingdom of Rwanda also had its administrative system. The Kingdom of Rwanda is known to have started in a small area of Gasabo. It enlarged to a bigger size and was named Rwanda rugari rwa Gasabo, meaning the big size of Rwanda. 

                The kingdom of Rwanda was headed by a king with a title of Umwami. This gave him dignity and respect among others. 
                
                The king had a centralised system of administration whereby he was the overall head of administration. He lived in a palace at the centre of a large court and was treated as a divine living. The court was mobile. In principle, he was the sole owner of land and cattle in the whole kingdom. </p>
                <h3>Administrative structure and central power </h3>
                <p>The king, as the head of the kingdom, had daily life that was rather unique. He lived alongside Abiru who performed various rituals as kingdom ritualists. Some words were specifically used on the life style of the king. For example: 

                 Carrying him on a stretcher (Kuremererwa) 
                    
                His speech (Irivuze umwami) 
                    
                 His palace (Ingoro)
                    
                     Travelling (Kurambagira) 
                    
                    His death (Gutanga) The king usually came from Abanyiginya clan. The kingâ€™s authority had a symbol of a sacred royal drum called Kalinga. There were other small drums such as Kiragutse, Mpatsibihugu and Rucabagome.</p>
                    <p>The king was a supreme judge and had power over life and death. He also had power to wage war and conquest, and to appoint and dismiss leaders.  He also administered justice in the kingdom. The king was a great personality because of different important roles he played. He was commonly referred to as Imana (God) and called usually as Nyagasani. </p>
                    <p>Abiru: These were officials of the kingdom in charge of ubwiru. The chief abiru came from Abatsobe clan. They were guardians of the tradition and kept the secrets of the kingdom.  They also advised and counselled the king, and kept the royal drum, Kalinga. 

                        Rwanda Kingdom was further divided into Districts called Ibiti, headed by chiefs appointed by the king. These Districts were further sub-divided into Ibikingi (Sub-districts) also headed by chiefs. Sub-districts were also subdivided into Imirenge and headed by a chief answerable to Ibikingi</p>
                    <p>The Queen mother: She was the biological mother of the king, though not in all cases. She was regarded as an important person in the palace in the exercise of power. She was the first chief advisor (counsellor) of the king. She guided the actions of the king. </p>
                    <p>Abiru: These were officials of the kingdom in charge of ubwiru. The chief abiru came from Abatsobe clan. They were guardians of the tradition and kept the secrets of the kingdom.  They also advised and counselled the king, and kept the royal drum, Kalinga. Rwanda Kingdom was further divided into Districts called Ibiti, headed by chiefs appointed by the king. These Districts were further sub-divided into Ibikingi (Sub-districts) also headed by chiefs. Sub-districts were also subdivided into Imirenge and headed by a chief answerable to Ibikingi</p>
                    <h3>Military/army (Ingabo)</h3>
                    <p>A new king recruited a new army. The king, based on the powers entrusted in him, appointed the head of the army. The head of the army was referred to as army chief (Umugaba wâ€™ingabo). The king was the commander-in-chief, and the army chief reported to him directly.</p>
                    <h4>Duties of the army chief </h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Recruiting fighters in the army; </li><br/>

                    <h3>Economic organisation </h3>
                    <h4>Agriculture</h4>
                    <p>This refers to growing of crops and rearing of animals. The ancient Kingdom of Rwanda people practised subsistence agriculture specifically to feed their own homes and families. People used their own hand-made hoes. They grew crops such as sorghum, millet, beans yams and pumpkins. </p>
                    <p>Slashing the bush for farming was the role of men while women resorted to weeding. They also looked after granaries.</p>
                    <h3>Cattle keeping</h3>
                    <p>Ancient Rwandan people were closely associated with rearing cattle. It was like a tradition to own cows. Various types and species of cows were reared. These included Inyambo, Inyankole and Inkuku cows. Men took the role of herding or looking after livestock. People of Rwanda also reared goats, sheep and chicken. Cows were reared for social exchange, prestige, respect, milk, food and skins.</p>
                    <h3>Commerce/trade </h3>
                    <p>Commerce refers to the buying and selling of goods especially on a large scale. In the past, it was carried out between different societies depending on the goods each sold. In traditional Rwandan society, people carried out trade as an economic activity</p>
                    <h3>Barter trade</h3>
                    <p> People exchanged goods for goods, and services for services. Main items used for exchange included cattle, skins and craft. They were exchanged within and outside Rwanda Kingdom. The kingdoms that Rwanda traded with included Ankole, Burundi, Buganda, Bushi and Karagwe. </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt> Art and craft </dt>
                        <dd>The people of ancient Rwanda were so skilled in making various things. They manufactured and produced items such as hoes, axes, swords, spears, hammers, knives and needles. They also made various products from weaving. Men wove trays, doors and stretchers. Women and girls wove mats and baskets. In carpentry, they made items such as spoons, stools, bows and plates.</dt>
                        <dt>Pottery

                        </dt>
                        <dd> Rwandans also obtained clay from swamps and made pottery. Products included pots for fetching water and keeping beer, and pipes for smoking tobacco. They also did some carpentry work. Products made included spoons, plates, stools, canoes, bows, playing boards, hair combs and pipes. </dd>
                        <dt> Bee keeping </dt>
                        <dd>Rwandans kept bees around the places where they lived. People made traditional bee hives and put them up in a tree branch to trap bees. Bee keepers harvested honey and its various products. This was after some time in dry season. Honey could be mixed with sorghum to make inkangaza and inturire local beer drinks. </dd>
                        <dt>Hunting The ancient </dt>
                        <dd>Rwandan people practised hunting as an economic activity. They hunted hares, leopards, porcupines, antelopes and gazelles. They tamed, trained and used specific tough dogs for hunting down the wild animals. Alongside dogs, they used other equipment such as spears, snares, arrows, and bows for hunting.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h3>Famine and epizooties</h3>
                    <p>The Kingdom of Rwanda suffered several famines during the pre-colonial period. People gave these famines different names depending on the harm made, villages affected and time. </p>
                    <p>Famines were primarily caused by prolonged sunshine that resulted to drought. The drought made plants dry out in gardens before the harvest season. </p>
                    <p>It was also because of constant wars of expansion that made so many people busy in fighting. They forgot to practise agriculture as people were still running up and down. They had no time to settle down and cultivate. </p>
                    <p>Poor timing of agricultural seasons culminated into famine at one time or another. Crops could either be affected by floods or meet sunshine season before reaching harvest season.</p>
                    <p>Pests and diseases also affected crops. They were eaten up by pests and attacked by various diseases leading to drying out. Common pests included locusts, grasshoppers, rodents and rats.</p>
                    <h4>Different famines that affected Rwanda at different times had far reaching effects. These were: </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> A big number of people and animals died due to lack of food and pasture respectively.</li><br/>
                        <li>Vegetation dried out leading to destruction of environment and natural beauty. This was felt especially in case where famine was caused by prolonged sunshine.</li><br/>
                        <li> Famine also affected the Kingdom of Rwanda negatively in terms of the economy. It led to reduction of royalties and taxes. </li><br/>
                        <li> People also suffered from poor feeding because of inadequate food supply in various families of Rwanda. Several granaries of families remained empty.</li><br/>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Some of the famines that affected Rwanda in the pre-colonial period include the following: </h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Macumu famine</li><br/>
                        <li>Rukungugu famine</li><br/>
                        <li>Muhatigicumuro famine </li><br/>
                        <li>Kijugunya famine </li><br/>
                        <li>Ruyaga famine</li><br/>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Socio-political and economic dependence in pre-colonial Rwanda</h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Ubuhake</dt>
                        <dd>This was a customary contract between the owner of the cattle and person who wished to acquire a cow. The owner of the cow was known as Sebuja (patron). The client was known as Umugaragu. 

                            The contract was because a person would be looking for protection from a more powerful patron. He would seek social protection from a wealthy patron. 
                            
                            The Ubuhake was primarily on individual liberty. One entered freely and left freely as he so wished especially after acquiring enough cows. This meant that he could then stand on his own.Patrons and clients had a common link and shared commitments as they made Ubuhake in the society.

                        </dd>
                            <dt>The following were the duties of the client: </dt>
                            <dd>Cultivating the fields of the patron </dd>
                            <dd> Looking after the cattle and ensuring that the milk was of good quality 

                            </dd>
                            <dd>Repairing homesteads </dd>
                            <dd>Guarding homes at night </dd>

                        <dt>Patronâ€™s duties included: </dt>
                        <dd> Protecting the client against those who were socially stronger than him and others likely to be enemies </dd>
                        <dd>Assisting the client in court </dd>

                        <dt>Ubukonde</dt>
                        <dd>This was a system where people gained rights to large tracts of land by being the first to clear and valorise the land (known as gukonda). In this system, a lineage held rights to land corporately and major decisions about managing land holdings were taken by the lineage chief (umutware wâ€™umuryango). The abakonde lineages held economic and political power over their ubukonde and could grant rights to abagererwa to use the land in their territory.

        <h1>Genocide NEVER AGAIN</h1><br>
        <h2>what is GENOCIDE</h2><br>
        <p>The 1948 United Nations (UN) convention on the prevention and
         punishment of the crime of genocide defines genocide as any act(s) committed with intent to destroy, 
        in whole or part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Th is involves the following acts:
        killing members of a certain group
        causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
        deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life
        calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part
        imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
        forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
            </p>

<h3>Development of genocide</h3><br>
<p>Classification: Distinguishing people into ‘us’ and ‘them’ by ethnicity, race, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>Symbolisation: Th is involves giving names or symbols to classify the victim group to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Discrimination: Usually takes a legal, cultural, custom, or political form used by the perpetrator group. They use power and authority to deny the rights of the victim group.</p>
<p>Dehumanisation: Th e perpetrator group treats the victim group as second class citizens. Dehumanisation makes the victim group easily vulnerable to the dominant group.</p>
<p>Organisation: Special army units or militias are usually trained and supplied with arms in readiness to carry out the nefarious activities.</p>
<p>Polarisation: Efforts are made by the dominant group to draw a sharp wedge between them and the victim group. Hate groups spread propaganda to reinforce prejudice and hatred between the two groups.</p>
<p>Preparation: This is done to ensure that everything takes place.
     Adequate preparations that entail identifi cation of victims and tools for use are made.</p><p>Th is stage begins with identification and separation of victims due to differences between them and the perpetrators. Death lists are drawn up.</p><p>Extermination: Killing of all the members of the victim group begins at this stage. With time, the killings take on genocidal proportions.</p><p>Denial: Denial is the surest indicator of further genocidal massacres.
         Perpetrators go to great lengths to conceal their acts and deny having committed any crime.</p>
        <h3>The Genocide against the Tutsi had long been in planning. 
            These plans were well advanced as early as 1990. </h3>
        <p>The perpetrators of the Genocide against the Tutsi used the death of the 
            then president Juvenal Habyarimana on 6th April 1994 as a pretext to exterminate the Tutsi. </p>
        <p>The genocide was planned by regime extremists whose 
            majority had enrolled into the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi to kill the Tutsi.</p>
        <p>The massacres were deliberate, carefully planned and well executed by Hutu extremists. 
            Hate propaganda was spread through mass media such as Radio Télévision Libre des Milles Collines (RTLM) and Kangura, a radical newspaper, as well as during political rallies and public gatherings. The extremists spread incitement to kill, along with constant verbal attacks on the Tutsi. They also published lists with names of hundreds of people to be killed and threatened anyone who had relations with the Tutsi. They referred to the Tutsi as ‘cockroaches’ and ‘snakes’. This was meant to dehumanise the Tutsi and to justify the acts of violence perpetrated against them.</p>
        <p>There was a Hutu power union between the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND),
             Coalition for Defence of the Republic Party (CDR), Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), Social Democratic Party (PSD) and Liberal Party (PL) who converged against the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its struggle to conquer power by force. They were armed, backed and led by the extremist government of Rwanda. They purchased a huge number of weapons such as machetes which were used to carry out the genocide. The weapons were distributed to the Interahamwe. Death squads such as Amasasu, Akazu and Reséau Zéro carried out the killings during the genocide.</p>
        <p>After the plane crash that killed President Habyarimana, road blocks manned by Hutu militiamen,
             often assisted by paramilitary police or military personnel were set up to identify the Tutsi. 
             They would systematically drive the victims from their homes and assemble them at pre-arranged places before killing them. Th e killings continued for a span of a hundred days and 1,074,0171 victims lost their lives.</p>
        <p>The United Nations (UN), United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) and
             western powers were aware of the regime preparing a genocide but they did nothing to stop it.
             <strong> By early July 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) forces had control of the majority of the country.</strong>
              <b> The RPF helped to stop the genocide and rescued the victims.</b>

        <h4>Loss of lives</h4>
        <p>Many lives are lost in  the event of a genocide  occurring, 
            for instance 6 million Jews and morethan 1,074,017 Tutsi were killed in the genocides.</p>
            <p>we lost many tutsi they were killed using tradtional weapons like  spears,arrows</p>

            <div>
        <h4>Sustainment of injuries</h4>
        <p>the lives of survivors forever Many people sustain
        injuries during genocide perpetration. Such injuries change.</p>

        <div>
        <h4> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</h4>
        <p>The occurrence of a genocide creates traumatic
        situations for the victims. Th ose who manage to survive
         do suff er from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 
         The ugly scenes survivors witness and many troubling
          conditions they endure during the genocide bring about
           PTSD. Victims also experience other psychological disorders, 
           depression and excessive anger.

        <div>
        <h4>Displacement of persons</h4>
        <p>Some victims flee from areas where genocide is taking place, to look for safety.

        <div>
        <h4>High number of orphans and other vulnerable dependants</h4>
        <p>The high number of deaths associated with genocide usually results in a high number of orphans and other vulnerable dependants. 
            As a result, the society is tasked to take care of the orphans.
             In worse cases, such children are left to fend for themselves and most end up as child-headed families.</p>

        <h4>Spread of sexually transmitted diseases and infections</h4>
        <p>Women and girls are raped and in some cases, contract sexually transmitted infections and diseases such as HIV and AIDS, gonorrhoea, herpes or syphilis.</p>

        <div>
        <h4>Damaged or destroyed relationships</h4>
        <p>The victim group and the perpetrator group usually develop mistrust towards one another. 
            This may prevent them from working together in future. 
            Genocide damages or destroys the good relationships that existed between the victims and perpetrators.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gen8-consequences">
            <div class=""><img src="C:\Users\ISHIMWE LUCKY\Downloads\died people.jpg" width="400"height="450" alt=""></div>
            <div>
        <h4>Destruction of property</h4>
        <p>During the occurence of a genocide, the victims’ properties are usually targeted too.
             Some are destroyed while others are illegally or forcefully acquired by the perpetrators.</p>
            </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>All the genocides witnessed in the world have led to negative impacts. Th is is why the occurrence of genocide should be avoided by any society. Human beings should not plan or implement a plan to murder others. Rationality should guide us into solving any perceived or real problems in a peaceful and an amicable manner.</p>

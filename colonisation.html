        <h1> First and Second Republics of Rwanda</h1>
        <h2>here we are going to discuss about the first and second republics of RWANDA</h2>
        <P>This period deals with the history of Rwanda

            from 1962, the year during which the country of Rwanda regained
            
            its independence up to 1990, the year that was marked by the
            
            beginning of the Liberation War.</P>
            <P>This war opened a new era which

                would be marked by many political and socio-economic changes
                
                and would be won by the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in 1994
                
                after stopping the genocide that was perpetrated against the Tutsi.
                
                This victory contributed to the collapse of the Second Republic and
                
                Rwanda opened a new page of its history with the coming of RPF
                
                to power.</P>

                    <dt>Political evolution</dt>
                    <dd>At the time of recovering Rwanda’s independence, Grégoire

                        Kayibanda bullied his way into political prominence and was more
                        
                        than willing to use ethnic terror and divisions to maintain his rule.
                        
                        By independence day on July 1st, 1962, Rwanda had no constitution.
                        
                        PARMEHUTU leaders had prepared a document to be used as a
                        
                        constitution during the coup d’état of Gitarama. But this text was
                        
                        not published in the official Gazette of Ruanda-Urundi. Moreover,
                        
                        the colonial authority continued thereafter to dictate laws for the
                        
                        new authorities. </dd>
                        <dd>A constitution project was proposed by PARMEHUTU and the Association Pour La Promotion Sociale De La Masse (APROSOMA).the vote took place during the meeting of November 23,1962;33 votes for,no vote against and 4 abstentions(3 from UNAR and 1 from APROSOMA).the final text was signed on november 24,1962 by 40 deputies</dd>
                        <dd>RWANDA had government headed by a president of the republiv and a parliament.according to the constitution,the power of the government was allocated to the president of the republic who was at the same time head of the state and heaf of government</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>The parliament had the power to supervise the actions of the

                    president of the republic and his government (Article 73). Under
                    
                    the First Republic, three legislatures were elected: in 1961, 1965
                    
                    and 1969, until the dissolution of the parliament following the July
                    
                    5th, 1973 coup d’état.
                    
                    From Multipartism to Monopartism
                    
                    The 1962 constitution devoted its article 10 to a multiparty system.</p>
                    <p>However, the ruling party, MDR PARMEHUTU, turned itself into

                        a ‘state party’, behaving just like a single party from 1963 after
                        
                        eliminating and assimilating other political parties.
                        
                        MDR PARMEHUTU fused with the state and the two institutions
                        
                        became one and the same at all administration levels. It means that
                        
                        the president of the republic was at the same time the president
                        
                        of MDR PARMEHUTU party. At the level of prefectures, the préfets
                        
                        were leaders of PARMEHUTU. The same applied in communes
                        
                        and the lower administrative levels.</p>
                        <p>MDR PARMEHUTU used different mechanisms to monopolise

                            political power. The party utilised intimidation tactics, arbitrary
                            
                            arrests and violence against opponents. At times although not
                            
                            often, it also tried to negotiate. In fact in such circumstances that
                            
                            APROSOMA disappeared in 1961, after the defection of its leaders
                            
                            to MDR PARMEHUTU. These included Aloys Munyangaju and
                            
                            Germain Gasingwa.</p>
                            <p>RADER and UNAR on the other disappeared

                                due to the killing of their leaders. These
                                
                                included Prosper Bwanakweli, Ndazaro
                                
                                Lazare and Karinda Callixte from RADER;
                                
                                and Michel Rwagasana, Afrika, Burabyo,
                                
                                Joseph Rutsindintwarane, Gisimba,
                                
                                Mpirikanyi and Ndahiro Denis from UNAR
                                
                                who were murdered in 1963.</p>
                                <p>They were

                                    executed in the prison of Ruhengeri when
                                    
                                    Inyenzi had just launched major attacks
                                    
                                    and had penetrated Bugesera up to

                                    <p>After recruiting some opposition leaders

                                        in its ranks and killing others, MDR
                                        
                                        PARMEHUTU transformed itself into a single party. In 1965, MDR
                                        
                                        PARMEHUTU was the only party which presented candidates for
                                        
                                        presidential and legislative elections.
                                        
                                        The Inyenzi incursions
                                        
                                        The first challenge faced by the First Republic was the problem
                                        
                                        of refugees. The attitude of the government of the First Republic
                                        
                                        varied with time.</p>
                                        <p>At the beginning of the 1960s, the provisional government had

                                            shown concern and established a state secretariat for refugees. But
                                            
                                            after every Inyenzi attack, the Tutsi inside the country would be
                                            
                                            killed. Survivors would seek asylum outside the country.</p>

                                                <dd>At independence, many government offices were in Bujumbura

                                                    which had been the colonial capital of Ruanda-Urundi. Rwanda
                                                    
                                                    was under-equipped. There were a few infrastructures. The country
                                                    
                                                    did not have a radio, an airport, permanent roads, a telephone

                                                    <dd>In addition, Rwanda lacked the financial means. It had only one

                                                        donor: Belgium. As a result Rwanda was dependent on foreign
                                                        
                                                        donors for most of her needs.
                                                        
                                                        Another economic problem faced by Rwanda was the poor

                                                        and Burundi. Moreover, the two countries did not have very good
